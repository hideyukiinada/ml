# Machine learning implementations

# Getting started
Have a look at [read me in examples](https://github.com/hideyukiinada/ml/blob/master/examples/readme.md) to get started.

# File list under the project directory

| Summary| File name | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Main neural network code| neuralnetwork.py | Implementation of a plain-vanilla neural network built from scratch with numpy | |
| Activation functions| activationfunction.py | Implementation of activation functions for neural network |
| Cost functions | costfunction.py | Implementation of cost functions for neural network including cross-entropy & MSE |
| K-means | kmeans.py | Implementation of k-means clustering method. Notes: As the below Wikipedia article points out, there is no guarantee that this implementation finds the optimal clustering result. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering |
