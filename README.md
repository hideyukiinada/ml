# Neural Network Implementations
This repository contains source code for the neural network (_NeuralNetwork_ class) that I implemented from scratch using numpy.  [Examples](https://github.com/hideyukiinada/ml/blob/master/examples) directory contains scripts that use NeuralNetwork class to solve specific problems.

# Getting started
Have a look at [read me in examples](https://github.com/hideyukiinada/ml/blob/master/examples/readme.md) to get started.

# Supported optimizers
* Batch gradient descent
* Mini-batch gradient descent/SGD
* Adam
