# GAN - Generative Adversarial Network implementation from scratch

## Overview
What kind of painting do you think Picasso would produce if he were still alive today?
Or, wouldn't it so cool if you can see another art by Andy Warhol?
GAN, or Generative Adversarial Network has potential to bring these dreams come close to reality.
GAN was invented by Mr. Ian Goodfellow in 2014.  You can refer to his original paper [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) if you are interested.

_Sample images generated by my GAN_

In short, GAN consists of two software objects:
* Generator
* Discriminator

Generator is responsible for generating a real-looking fake image from noise.
Discriminator is responsible for telling the fake objects from real objects.
During a training process, you alternate training for Discriminator and Generator.  As you iterate through many cycles, Generator learns to produce more real-looking fake images.
Now GAN became very popular and there are many variants.  Most notably DCGAN and CYCLE GAN.  The latter can generate images of zebras from horse images!

In this article, I would like to dive a little deeper and explaine how I implemented GAN to generate digit (number) looking images from scratch.

## More ideas behind and Implementations
### Training Discriminator
To train Discriminator, you feed the following data to it:
1) Small batch of real MNIST digits as samples.  1 is fed for each of the sample as the ground-truth for these.
2) Small batch of fake digits generated by the Generator.  0 is fed for each of the image telling Discriminator to consider each image as a fake.

### Training Generator
To train Generator, you feed the following data to it:
1) Small batch of noise as samples.  1 is fed for each of the sample as the ground-truth for these. 

Generator converts this noise to what it thinks is a real-looking digit image. Whether the digit is real or fake is judged by Discriminator. What this means is that Generator will try to adjust itself so that it generates an image that looks real to Discriminator. 

### Structure of Discriminator
Discriminator consists of two-layer neural network with 28 pixel by pixel image as an input, 512 units in a hidden layer, 1 unit on the output layer:
```
discriminator = Model(num_input=28 * 28)
discriminator.add(Layer(512, activation=af.RELU))
discriminator.add(Layer(1, activation=af.SIGMOID))
```
